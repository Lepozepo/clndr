# CLNDR for Meteor
This package provides a simple way to create a date picker using [CLNDR](https://github.com/kylestetz/CLNDR).

## Installation

``` sh
$ meteor add lepozepo:clndr
```

__Note: I'm not convinced with this package yet so I haven't published it, it works great but most calendar related inputs can usually be solved without a calendar.__
